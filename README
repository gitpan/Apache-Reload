Apache::Reload

This module is designed as both a drop-in replacement for Apache::StatINC
and an improvement on that module allowing you to define modules that
get Reloaded on change without having to stat() the whole of %INC.

Apache::Reload gets installed as a PerlInitHandler, just like Apache::StatINC. 
On every request it checks the list of modules/files to determine which
files it needs to reload. In normal mode it works just like StatINC, going
through the whole of %INC checking each module in turn. In "Import" mode,
it goes through the list of modules that have added:

	use Apache::Reload;

to their code. This allows you much finer grained control over the number of 
stat() calls being made on each hit, and allows you to add that module into
your application code, and leave it out of core modules that you know won't
be changing.
